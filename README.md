# Intro Mixer

##Motivation
The Intro Mixer is designed to play annoucement music while pre-recorded team introduction tracks are played. It allow for a master volume and mixed volume to be set. Additionally it allows for "other music" to be played randomly when introductions are not being done.

##Use
The exe file uses the .NET 4.0 and depends on a few folders to be defined. the .config file lists these folders locations and they can be updated to suite your needs. The mp3's (or other .NET compatible audio file) for the team introductions need to be seperated by a dash e.g. Team Name - Coach.

-Good Luck
